package tudelft.sum;

public class TwoNumbersSumTest {
    /*
        The function of addTwoNumbers should add two non-negative integers from which the digits are stored separately in an arraylist. For example, the number 12 would be stored as ArrayList(1,2).

        You can assume that there are no zeros in the beginning of the ArrayList i.e: not ArrayList(0, 0, 2);

        See our implementation in the TwoNumbersSum class (package tudelft.sum). There's a bug in this implementation. Apply everything you learned and do your best to find the bug!! Write your automated tests inside TwoNumbersSumTest class. At the end, push your solution to your GitHub repository.
