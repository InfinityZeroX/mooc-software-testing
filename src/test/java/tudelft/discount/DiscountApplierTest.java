    /*
        The DiscountApplier class is responsible for applying the new discounts on the prices of the product. If the category of the product is HOME, the new price should now be 90% of the old price. If the category of the product is BUSINESS, the new price should be 110% of the old price.

        You will have to use mocks to simulate the ProductDao class, the one responsible for getting all the products from the database.

        There's a bug in our implementation. Use everything you learned so far to test this class and fix the bug. Write your tests inside the DiscountApplierTest class. At the end, push your solution to your GitHub repository.
