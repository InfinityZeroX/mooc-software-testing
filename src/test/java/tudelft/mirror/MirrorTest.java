public class MirrorTest {
    /*
        Given a string, look for a mirror image (backwards) string at both the beginning and end of the given string. In other words, zero or more characters at the very begining of the given string, and at the very end of the string in reverse order (possibly overlapping). For example, the string "abXYZba'' has the mirror end "ab''.

        Examples:

            mirrorEnds("abXYZba") ==> "ab"
            mirrorEnds("abca") ==> "a"
            mirrorEnds("aba") ==> "aba"

        A (buggy) implementation of this problem can be found in the Mirror class (mirror package). Apply everything you learned so far and find the bug. Write tests in the MirrorTest class. At the end, push your solution to GitHub. Tip: Think about even and uneven input lengths.
